## Restaurants woth lazyloading and blurhash

This is a simple react app to try out lazyloading and blurhash for some Wolt restaurant data.

To run the app locally, just do a git clone, npm install and npm run start-dev.

Some testing would have been nice, but after a long time of debugging I just can't make the blurhash package work with jest!
